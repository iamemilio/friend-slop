class_name SpellSyncLane
extends RefCounted

## Multiplayer persistence model for spell visuals / world effects.
## Pick one lane when adding a spell — do not invent a fourth replication style.
##
## PLAYER_BOUND — runs on the caster avatar (haste, flashlight). Wire carries
##   scalars only; every peer applies to that caster player node.
##
## EPHEMERAL — fire-and-forget projectile or one-shot FX (fireball). Pack spawn
##   pose into the cast wire; every peer spawns and simulates locally. No spawn_id,
##   no later remove/flicker RPC. Child impact VFX ride the local sim.
##   Use SpellEphemeralFx.
##
## WORLD_OBJECT — lasting interactive prop (fake wall, light ball). Cast wire
##   spawns with a stable id; later Target / Dispell / touch events use
##   SpellWorldSync. Mutate and despawn go through the shared world-event RPC.
##
## TARGETED — operates on an existing world object or mark (target, pull, follow,
##   dispell). Wire carries kind + mark / spawn_id / grid; apply resolves the
##   object on each peer. Despawn of world objects still uses SpellWorldSync.
